		 description="Through the smart application of liquid metal, forcefully relocate the inhabitants to your housing and deconstruct the building itself to free up the land plot. Liquid metal will be assimilated into the building and make it look as if building fell apart from structural decay. Liquid metal usage depends on size, volume, complexity and other physical properties of the building itself."
