		description="You spent a huge amount of time and energy inventing and extending a powerful network of structures that were a mixture of above-ground and hidden.
Now that Vorsiber has declared open war, most of that is useless. You barely have any storage space."
		strategy_tip="That said, there are trapped people still active all through the city, picking through the wreckage. There are still humanoid robots among them.
You'll have to be much more subtle than before, but you can carve out a life here."
