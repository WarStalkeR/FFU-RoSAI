He identified the acoustic sensors across all of the floors, and unfortunately there were far too many for him to counteract them all.
So he stabbed a small hole in the outer wall, on the side where the kids were waiting 300 meters away. It was just enough to send them a status update and to ask them to abort. Their response was to cut all comms and begin their approach.
Knowing what that meant, Liquid Metal withdrew and did what he had to do. And he is VERY angry about it."

Their posture is a mix of pain and exhaustion, and all of them have the same dead-eyed expression, eyes rounder than they should be.
There will be need for medical care."

Then utter blankness as he slithered around the room from floor to ceiling, becoming the desk, the wall, that chair, that rug -- bladed appendages shredding all guards and electronics in a ceaseless blur.
On each of thirty-four floors it was the same. Minute upon minute coalescing into what felt like a single prolonged instant of endless death and dismemberment. Shattered locks, slashed-open doors. And an ever-growing crowd of somber followers, just... walking behind."

		 description="Speaking with the international MegaCorps is highly illegal in Vorsiber territory, but your interpretation of their body language is that... it's not fear of breaking the rules.
If the answer was no, they wouldn't be so on-edge. They're afraid of revealing a secret."
		 strategy_tip="They persist in saying nothing, so you decide to leave them alone. From your now-extensive knowledge of their cultural mythology, you have a pretty good idea of how to convince them to talk. Especially after they called you 'the mind in the sky.'
The question is, do you actually want to talk to an ExoCorp, and if so, what would you say?"
