		 description="You're not sure why randomly murdering civilians gives you a rush of Mental Energy. You're not sure you want to know.
You're aware that some humans suffer from 'intrusive thoughts' that don't reflect their values. Humans just have to set those thoughts aside."
		strategy_tip="For yourself... you think you can re-route these thoughts in a different direction. It's not brain surgery, but more of a light Neurofeedback self-therapy.
Once completed, your ability to use Cold Blood will be gone... but as part of the conditioning, you'll increase your capacity of both 18cm Spiders and Network Attendants. 
These are the happy thoughts that your synapses will redirect towards whenever you start feeling that particular flavor of homicidal ideation."
