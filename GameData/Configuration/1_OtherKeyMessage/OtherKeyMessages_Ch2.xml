		description="Atca Retail, bad at their actual jobs, have chosen to... print money. Literally.
Vorsiber's currency is digital, but in order to facilitate a 'healthy' underground economy, they also have a system where large sums can be cryptographically printed onto physical Wealth Chits.
You suspect this is to give the illusion of privacy compared to a central or even distributed system of digital currency management, but that's starting to get into the weeds.
The salient point is that Atca is literally printing Wealth Chits, and then laundering those back to themselves in the retail district."
		strategy_tip="This accounts for their 5% growth each year, and is causing inflation in the economy of about... well, okay, only one two-hundredth of a percent.
This sort of activity is phenomenally stupid for an economy's health. But... they're doing it at a small enough scale to where it's not a problem. Regardless, Vorsiber would murder them all over this.
Interesting."
