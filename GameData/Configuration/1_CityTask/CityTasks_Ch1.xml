		description="Let's start by getting some groundwater, and then we'll worry about filtering it.
You probably have a bunch of research options queued up.  You can click the indicator in the upper left, or press {0}, and then choose Groundwater Acquisition to skip to the item you need right now."
		strategy_tip="After that is researched, build it from the build menu like usual.
Feel free to quickly end a bunch of turns to speed through this part. There's no time pressure at the moment."

		line_2="Build things faster!"
		description="If you select one of your Technician androids, and then {0} the building that is under construction, it will speed up construction by one turn."
		strategy_tip="This is something you can do repeatedly, even on a single turn, so {0} several times and your Well And Cistern will be done in no time."

		description="During the prologue, you did one kind of investigation. Now it's time to do the second style. 
The quickest way to get started is to {0} the Investigate notice above this. That will select a valid investigator (you must have a Technician), and switch the current lens to Investigations."
		strategy_tip="Then press {0} to go to the map view.
You'll see some very large green circles. These are your options for places to investigate. They're all the same, except for potential danger around them.
Choose one and move your Technician to it.
Maybe don't bring your favorite technician, if you care? Also don't worry about bringing backup..."

		line_2="Don't panic."
		description="This is how you probe an unknown dangerous situation. Send in one sacrificial unit, and see what happens."
		strategy_tip="In this particular case, if you examine the stats of the SecForce Cruiser, you'll see that it has armor. None of your units can destroy it.
This will lead to a burst of inspiration, where you can then go off and get more powerful, then come back for revenge.
For now, end the current turn and let your poor Technician meet its fate. These enemies will leave once the perceived threat is gone."

		line_2="You Need Armor Piercing"
		description="The combat with the SecForce Cruiser is unwinnable. Let's fix that.
It has armor, so you need to develop armor-piercing."
		strategy_tip="You've had a stroke of inspiration. Follow the instructions in the Steal Prismatic Tungsten project that has started.
The general idea is to use StreetSense and a group of CombatUnits to infiltrate a military base and steal things.
If you haven't done any improvements of your unit loadouts yet, now is also the time to do that; see the handbook if you need further information."

		line_2="Ability Bar Slot 3"
		description="Take a look at slot 3 on your ability bar, Use Consumable Items. From now on, you can use any items you invent from there."
		strategy_tip="There is a 'Stack Armor Piercing' project that has now started, and it has detailed information on how to use armor piercing rounds.
To save on prismatic tungsten, you may want to:
1. Position your units in a ring around your target investigation site.
2. Do the triple-stack of armor piercing on a single CombatUnit, ideally one high on a building.
3. End the turn, to refresh your mental energy.
4. Have your technician start the investigation.
5. Kill the cruiser, then everything else that comes at you."

		line_2="It's Time For Revenge"
		description="This time you should bring four units. Three CombatUnits, and a single Technician.
See the notes in 'Using Items,' above, for a recommended pre-battle plan."
		strategy_tip="Once battle starts, your CombatUnit with the triple-stack of armor-piercing kills the Cruiser. The Cruiser will die in 2-3 shots if your unit is on a tall building above it. If your CombatUnit is not high enough, then you may not have enough Mental Energy to both take out the Cruiser and keep your Technician alive.
The rest of your CombatUnits should then pick off ground forces. More troops will arrive for a few turns, until your Technician is finished.
If you have trouble, consider using Microbuilder Clouds (after researching Swarm Cloud) to protect your Technician."

		description="If there are any enemies left from this battle, be sure to clean them up so they don't go attacking your buildings.
Then research Acoustic Nanotube Filtration, build however many filtration towers you want to reach your goal (no more than 2), and that's it for 'Securing Water!'"
		strategy_tip="The sequence you just completed is the most complicated stretch of chapter one.
You've learned a lot from doing it, so you'll be well suited to tackle later challenges.
Be sure to have ample electricity. This task will only complete when you have 8,900 filtered water produced in a turn."

		line_2="You Got This"
		description="This is dramatically easier than the water project that came before it."
		strategy_tip="There are four options for food, of varying complexity. 
The 'canned protein' is highly unethical but super easy.
Providing just vat-grown meat is also quite simple.
If you want to provide both meat and greens, that's a bit more involved, but still nothing compared to the water project."

Short version: move a shard to lower numbers to 'eat' them and become larger. If you move a shard in such a way that it would have a value of 99 or more, it will split into two shards, instead."

Threatened cells are shown with a fiery red border. Blocked cells are dimmed (you can Jump over those if you are stuck).
Try moving around a bit."

You cannot destroy daemons without splitting, so this is very important."

Keep one shard safe, and move the other just outside the danger zone of a daemon. When it moves next to you, corrupt your shard to destroy it."
