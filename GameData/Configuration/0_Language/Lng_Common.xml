	<lang id="Beacon_Subheader" text="Beacon" translation_notes="Beacons are basically just icons that show up on the map for navigational reasons.  Every POI is a beacon, but a variety of other buildings that are not a full POI have beacons.  These basically just help the player find things of interest, above a certain threshold of importance.  So for example, all of the thousands of midrise towers and apartment buildings do not have beacons.  Small shops and whatnot do not have beacons.  But there are comparably few mech parts factories or courthouses, and those each get their own beacons despite not being a full POI.  A typical city has about 32,000 to 36,000 distinct buildings in it, and maybe 600 beacons.  That is still an overwhelming number of icons if you are zoomed out, hence the 'key beacons' which limits that down to more like 50-80." />
