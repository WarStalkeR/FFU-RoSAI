	<lang id="HaveEnoughSlurrySpiders_StrategyTip" text="Use the Build menu to construct Slurry Spiders within network range of your tower. Each one will take one turn to complete. If you run low, your androids can Gather more elemental slurry." />

	<lang id="ResearchMicrobuilderMiniFabs_Explanation" text="In order to start constructing microbuilders, you'll need to research." />
	<lang id="ResearchMicrobuilderMiniFabs_StrategyTip" text="You'll need to progress the turn before your research will complete.
Since there's not much else going on right now, use the &lt;b&gt;{0}&lt;/b&gt; key to skip directly to the next turn." />

	<lang id="HaveEnoughMicrobuilderMiniFabs" text="Build {0} Microbuilder Mini-Fabs" />
	<lang id="HaveEnoughMicrobuilderMiniFabs_Explanation" text="Most construction projects will require Microbuilders. These in turn require elemental slurry to construct." />
	<lang id="HaveEnoughMicrobuilderMiniFabs_StrategyTip" text="Your Microbuilders are unique because they remain semi-active and can grow and learn over time.
You will continue to use these microbuilders to build more structures." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Header" text="About Game" />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Introduction_Header" text="Introduction" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Introduction_Body" text="You are a newborn AI who wakes up in a grim dystopian city. You have no ties, no loyalties, and a frightening amount of power. Gameplay directs your growth, builds power, and evolves with your inner nature. You will see the consequences reflected on the world around you, for good or ill." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_BigPicture_Header" text="What Is This Game, Big Picture?" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_BigPicture_Body" text="This game is a novel mix of tactics, city-building, 4X/strategy, and RPG." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_EarlyFlow_Header" text="What Is The Early Flow?" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_EarlyFlow_Body" text="The Prologue and Chapter one are linear tutorials. The prologue covers basic controls and a sample combat.
Chapter One covers tactics and city-building. It also includes optional side content.
Chapter Two begins the main game and progresses into non-linear branching scenarios." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_OngoingFlow_Header" text="What Is The Ongoing Flow?" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_OngoingFlow_Body" text="An experienced player will play Chapter Two across many timelines, exploring new paths and dealing with the consequences each time. The game has an extensive breadth of experiences and wide volume of things to explore.
Later chapters, available one year after launch, will advance the metagame." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Relax_Header" text="This Is A Relaxed Experience, Usually" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Relax_Body" text="You are not racing against anyone. The city is your enemy and it is corrupt, stagnant and resistant to change. 
As with most RPGs, the plot will progress at your pace. If you wish to focus on side content before resuming your chosen path, that's absolutely fine.
Once you trigger an event, gameplay may become tense from time pressure and challenge until the event is complete.
The worst case scenario is (almost) never a full loss, but an opportunity to experience a new set of circumstances." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Difficulty_Header" text="How Difficulty Works" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Difficulty_Body" text="Starting in Chapter Two, any core path will become impossibly hard without doing some side content. (Extremely skilled players, have fun with that.) 
Side content offers you new tools that make the core game easier -- assuming you avoid obviously-provocative actions. 
There is no right answer to the scenarios in this game; it is up to the player." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Tactical_Header" text="Tactical Combat" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Tactical_Body" text="You control an elite group of androids, mechs, and vehicles. Your units will engage in tactical combat. You control their movement, attack, and use of items and abilities. The tactical mechanics in this game are not as deep as a pure tactics game -- combat is just one of several means to an end." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Heart_Header" text="The Heart of This Game..." />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Heart_Body" text="...is choice and consequence. The game has hand-crafted scenarios which can be tackled in a couple of ways. You then deal with the consequences, and that, of course, leads to further choices." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Checklist_Header" text="The Task Stack In The Upper Right..." />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Checklist_Body" text="...is always the core path forward. This is 'what is next' for you to do.
Once the Contemplate ability opens up, you are free to get lost in side content. Most people enjoy swapping back and forth." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Endings_Header" text="There Are Many Possible Endings" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Endings_Body" text="Your victory conditions are defined by what you want to accomplish. At launch there will be around 10 distinct 'game endings' each achievable by routes with multiple branches. Post-launch, that number will to grow to over 40 possible endings." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_CityBuilding_Header" text="The City-Building Part" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_CityBuilding_Body" text="This game is a 4X RPG at heart. The city-builder and tactics components enrich the experience.
Your City-building choices affect your path and are your means to gaining soft power. What you build, and where, can give you leverage over the city's power-hungry elite." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_NewStuff_Header" text="There's Constantly New Stuff" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_NewStuff_Body" text="Units will change and be recontextualized throughout the game. There is no memorization component.
When you see a unit icon you don't recognize, hover over it. It's a chance to find out 1) who that is 2) what they are doing 3) possibly why. This helps inform your choices." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Tapestry_Header" text="This Is A Tapestry To Be Unraveled" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Tapestry_Body" text="This giant city is densely populated. There are dozens of active factions vying for power. Don't stress about the who's who!  There is no quiz.
The game is about what YOU want. The city's factions may intersect with your goals. You'll get a sense of each group as they become relevant." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Subterfuge_Header" text="Subterfuge, not Stealth" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Subterfuge_Body" text="In this game you may choose to affect change through hard power (coercive action through military might), soft power (shaping or co opting the compliance of other through appeal or attraction) or subterfuge. You can't stay invisible (wouldn't be much of a game if you could) but you do have the power to posture, destroy, distract, deter, and mislead your way to power and control in the city." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Humans_Header" text="Humans Are Essential, But Not Equals" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Humans_Body" text="The city is filled with humans...at least for now. While you can't ignore them, it's up to you how your presence affects them. 
Are they livestock?   Do you provide for them?  Will you completely eliminate them?  Think carefully about that last question. Why?  Well... spoilers for some very cool reveals later in chapter one." />

	<lang id="AboutGame_Last_Header" text="Last Details About The Flow" />
	<lang id="AboutGame_Last_Body" text="Gameplay is intentionally open-ended. The scenarios are all hand-crafted, but which ones you choose, how you combine them on the city map, and which branches you take, are all up to you. You can choose a mix of  military, social, technology, or espionage goals.
There are possibilities everywhere, some visible, some secret. To become the supreme overlord of the city, pick scenarios that seem to work towards that goal. If you want to have sapient dinosaurs, then genetics-related options are going to be the priority.
Wandering, following where the game takes you, and ending up somewhere unexpected are the keys to the experience.
This is a game about exploring possibilities. The endings are interesting, but the wild paths you take to get there are the true prize." />
