		strategy_tip="This might sound strange, but you can probably relate this to some experiences in your own life. Sometimes the result is inevitable.
In those cases, what changes is YOU. Doing things one way or another leads to changes in yourself -- or in this case, in your units, equipment, or structures.

Demolishing very large buildings using explosives will get you marked defective, as will certain other very-scary abilities."

If the hacker is only suspicious of your presence but hasn’t fully detected your unit, attacking them sets off an alarm. This triggers security measures, causing your infiltrator to take damage from the alerted forces inside the building. These are always secretive Infiltration missions -- if someone realizes an intruder is inside, everything escalates."
		strategy_tip="In cases where you can freely kill hackers, they’re not actively tracking an infiltrator inside a high-security area.

It is a very violent society, but there are psychological incentives in place that keep it stable. But the citizens are not safe."
		strategy_tip="The rebel groups have no hope of a larger victory. They rail against heated issues, and their firepower is too limited to affect a city-wide change.
This city is so stable that it would take an unimaginably powerful organization -- or being -- to upend things. 
Along the way, if this is your goal, you'll wind up seeing a lot of the psychological controls and how they interlock to trap the populace. There's quite a bit to untangle."

Vorsiber management is absolutely salivating at the prospect of getting something exceptionally valuable out of this.
Far from wanting to destroy your tower, they want to steal whatever comes out of it."

What their executives want is the same thing that all earthbound humans want -- to get off the planet. The blockade by the human space nations make that impossible.
But if your tower yielded an exciting technology for the humans, the executives believe that could be their ticket off-planet."

But don't despair -- for the most part, they prefer to keep their distance.

Vorsiber has 18 federated corporations under it. It owns them all, but they operate fairly independently -- and, critically, compete with one another."

There are also thousands of Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents (VPs and SVPs) that are 'upper management' in each of these corporations. They are more impressive on paper than they are in reality. Their primary duty is to be scapegoats.
Below that are a variety of middle managers, and then the actual workers."

Taking a look at the Victory Path screen is a great way to look at possible goals that seem interesting, or that you have not yet tried."

If you find yourself stuck on a goal at some point, then continue returning and looking for more contemplations. Looking at the goal description again may also help; some goals have cross-timeline requirements."

Even if the exploration site shifts to a new location, that work is retained in the current timeline.

Predators in particular can be overkill in almost all circumstances on normal difficulty, but on the higher difficulties, their relevance skyrockets.
You will also have a hard time if you don't do enough Exploration Sites related to your strategy; these require you to be 'down some unit capacity' for some turns, but yield large rewards. You'll need to make use of these against higher-difficulty foes, or it may just feel like enemies are too tough to take down."
