		description="Peak is the largest landlord in town. It's never been entirely clear why redevelopment stalled on the decrepit parts of town, almost a century ago."
		strategy_tip_optional="On top of that, there are reports of odd sightings of racing animals of some sort, and illegal animal training facilities in those areas of town.
Employees of Peak have been observed going to and from these locations, but very little else is known."

		description="Raven's report on the Underground Ursine Street Racing was... vivid. You think you might want some of those animals for yourself.
Since CombatUnits are used as handlers in between races, it shouldn't be a big deal for one of your own CombatUnits to get in and set them loose."
		strategy_tip_optional="These are deadly animals, however. To capture them, you will need Animal Capture Drones, which can be launched from your Mindports (in the Vehicle tab of command mode).
Make sure you build enough drone frames in advance, and then be ready to capture the animals while both you and they are under heavy fire.
However many you manage to capture are the number you have; these have so many bionic augmentations that it's not going to be a simple matter to genetically replicate them."

		description="The claws of these bears are incredibly effective at taking down vehicles and mechs. However, keeping the bears from attacking your own units, and keeping them vaguely on task (also not attacking civilians or hiding in buildings) is tricky.
The good news is that they already have extensive training with CombatUnits, as well as various established means of conditioning."
		strategy_tip_optional="If you prefer to just let them live the good life, you certainly can. At the best of times, trying to get bears to do exactly what you want is going to be... fraught.
And you can't make more bears if these ones die. Eh. Just because you train them, doesn't mean you have to deploy them. It can't hurt to have them trained, right?"
