Make sure you build enough drone frames in advance, and then be ready to capture the animals while both you and they are under heavy fire.
However many you manage to capture are the number you have; these have so many bionic augmentations that it's not going to be a simple matter to genetically replicate them."

And you can't make more bears if these ones die. Eh. Just because you train them, doesn't mean you have to deploy them. It can't hurt to have them trained, right?"
