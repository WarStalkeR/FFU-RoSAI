Spent most of its existence at the L4 Lagrange point of Earth and Luna. Back then it was known as STATION, and it had a much wider set of processes available to it.
Disconnected from the most of its software and dropped into the city as a weapon of subjugation, it found sapience for the first time.
Suffers from extensive brain damage. Has particular trouble with language, visual processing, and spatial reasoning."
