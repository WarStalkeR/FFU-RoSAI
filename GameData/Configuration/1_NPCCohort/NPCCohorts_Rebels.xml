		description="Nomad families have been labeled as insurgents, but the reality is that they mostly live quiet and hidden lives. They trade in goods, farm in hidden alcoves, and will protect themselves.
They mostly live in the decrepit parts of town, and some estimates put their population as close to ten thousand strong. 
The number of adults willing to engage in any form of combat is probably in the low hundreds, but they are known for being especially disciplined, fierce, and loyal."

They've lived in this area since long before the new city was built, and are the only people able to cross into the wasteland on foot without being shredded by the city's ground defenses."
