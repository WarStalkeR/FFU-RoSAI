SettingSubcategory/setting_subcategory/=SaveSafeModsdescription|These mods don't require all the players in a multiplayer game to have them on.  Additionally, you can load a savegame that had such a mod without it showing as present.
      
A number of these change balance for the game, and in multiplayer it's a good idea for all players to have those same mods on, but it's not required.  In cases where ships stats or other mechanics differ, the host's simulation will take precedence.

In other cases, if these are purely cosmetic, then it really doesn't matter what things look like to you versus someone else.
