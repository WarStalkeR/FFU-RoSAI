We have bought this building with one of our shell companies and own it outright.
Deployment Hub
Used for drop pods and drop ships, to get combat units into position and defend other machine lairs within proximity.
This building is partly taken over by a hidden factory within itself.
Mind Farm
This building is partly taken over by racks and racks of unconcious humans whose minds are being used as a neural net for our own purposes.
Biolab
This building is partly taken over by a biolab that can do a variety of things.
Harvester
This building is partly taken over by a facility from which robotic drones harvest from nearby buildings in an automated fashion to gather resources from unsuspecting humans.
Control Tower
This building has a massive machine brain in it that helps us coordinate activities throughout the district.
