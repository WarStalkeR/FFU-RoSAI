Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldAutofocusDistanceShiftdisplay_name|Main DOF: Autofocus Distance Offset
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldAutofocusDistanceShiftdescription|If you would like for the autofocus of the depth of field to skew higher or lower, then you can adjust this positive or negative.  The default of 0 means no offset.
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldDownsamplingdisplay_name|Main DOF: Downsampling
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldDownsamplingdescription|With downsampling above 1, you'll get better performance, but progressively worse image quality (mainly edges not lining up correctly).  With a downsampling of 1, no downsampling is done.
			 
Defaults to 2 on the main camera.
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldMaxSamplesdisplay_name|Main DOF: Max Samples
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldMaxSamplesdescription|More samples leads to a higher quality visual effect, but at the cost of performance.
			 
Defaults to 4 on the main camera.
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldImageSensorHeightdisplay_name|Main DOF: Image Sensor Height
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldImageSensorHeightdescription|How high is the simulated image sensor?  No impact on performance, but impacts how the camera effect behaves.  Default is 24.
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldFStopdisplay_name|Main DOF: F-Stop
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldFStopdescription|What is the f-stop of the simulated camera lens?  The f-stop of camera is fractional, so this is the denominator of that fraction.  If you choose 2.6, then that would be an f-stop of 1/2.6 for photographers.
			 
The smaller the number, the shallower the depth of field (the smaller the amount of the image that will be in focus, and the more dramatic the background focus), while the larger the number, the wider the focus.

In the normal camera mode, we use a default of 7, which is not on the wider end, making blur far less dramatic than in photo mode.
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldFocalLengthRealdisplay_name|Main DOF: Focal Length
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldFocalLengthRealdescription|What is the focal length of the simulated camera lens?  The focal length of the lens is the distance between the lens and the image sensor when the subject is in focus, in millimeters.
			 
This affects the magnification of the scene, for depth of field purposes.  The default of 24mm keeps most of the image crisp in the regular mode, but also fairly flat.
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldForegroundDistancedisplay_name|Main DOF: Foreground Distance
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldForegroundDistancedescription|This has no analogue in physical cameras.  This specifies how close to the camera foreground blur should kick in.  The default of 0.25 leads to a 'small world' visual effect, since we are simulating everything at 1/10th normal scale.
			 
To get something that seems more like normal scale, reduce this number, potentially as low as 0.025.
Setting/setting/=Camera_depthOfFieldBokehThresholddisplay_name|Main DOF: Bokeh Threshold

The smaller the number, the shallower the depth of field (the smaller the amount of the image that will be in focus, and the more dramatic the background focus), while the larger the number, the wider the focus.

In the photo mode camera, we use a default of 2, which is on the narrow end of things.
Setting/setting/=PhotoMode_depthOfFieldFocalLengthRealdisplay_name|Photo Mode DOF: Focal Length
Setting/setting/=PhotoMode_depthOfFieldFocalLengthRealdescription|What is the focal length of the simulated camera lens?  The focal length of the lens is the distance between the lens and the image sensor when the subject is in focus, in millimeters.
			 
This affects the magnification of the scene, for depth of field purposes.  The default of 50mm is probably fine for most purposes.
Setting/setting/=PhotoMode_depthOfFieldForegroundDistancedisplay_name|Photo Mode DOF: Foreground Distance
Setting/setting/=PhotoMode_depthOfFieldBokehThresholddisplay_name|Photo Mode DOF: Bokeh Threshold
Setting/setting/=PhotoMode_depthOfFieldBokehThresholddescription|At what level of light do we start seeing bokeh, or visual artifacts from out of focus elements?  The default of 0.8 will show it for fairly bright objects, with brighter objects having a stronger effect.

The purpose of this is mainly to use with diffing tools between this copy and the on-main-load copy and see if something went wrong during the reload.  If you are modding and made changes to some ships and want to see how those changes cascaded, this would be one way to do that.  This is also a way for us to verify correctness when we make structural changes internally.

Setting/setting/=FramerateTypedisplay_name|Framerate
Setting/setting/=FramerateTypedescription|Please note that this is NOT the same as setting a refresh rate on your monitor.  Mostly.
 <size=9>       
If you set VSync or Half-VSync, then indeed it will limit to those and you will likely see terrible performance.  Using vsync is a really bad idea, in that it really causes issues with variable-length frames, and will make your game choppier.

Assuming that you are using any other options in this list, it is telling the game to 'try to run at about that framerate.'  That won't actually mean the game runs at that framerate, but it will mean that the game tries to not run on average MORE than that framerate.  For one example, you don't need the game running at 300fps for no reason and having your GPU fan going nuts.  On the other hand, if the game gets choppy when above 60fps for you on an older machine, you might want to cap it at 60fps.  If you wish to set this to match your monitor refresh rate, that is fine, but please bear in mind that the non-vsync versions of this are very very much 'weak suggestions for maximum framerate,' and not any sort of hard limiter.

Setting/setting/=MainCamera_MinPitchdescription|What is the shallowest (most sideways) angle the camera can look down?  Default is 10.
			 
If you go negative, that will let the camera look back upwards more (usually this is more of a photo mode angle).
Setting/setting/=MainCamera_MaxPitchdisplay_name|Camera Max Pitch
Setting/setting/=MainCamera_MaxPitchdescription|What is the steepest angle the main camera can look down?  The defauult is 70.

Parametrically-applied trees and flowers and trash and such in the areas of 'wilderness' cells within the city will be blank instead, but this does not affect function in any way.
Setting/setting/=CellDrawDist_Buildingsdisplay_name|Cell Draw Distance: Buildings
Setting/setting/=CellDrawDist_Buildingsdescription|The game is broken up into visual cells for drawing.  How many cells away should be drawn when looking sideways, as far as buildings go?  Larger amounts will look cooler for photos, but give a lower framerate.
		   
The default of 5 is not a bad idea in most cases, because buildings are large but only so numerous.  This keeps the skyline the most accurate and avoids pop-in.
Setting/setting/=CellDrawDist_Roadsdisplay_name|Cell Draw Distance: Roads
Setting/setting/=CellDrawDist_Roadsdescription|The game is broken up into visual cells for drawing.  How many cells away should be drawn when looking sideways, as far as roads go?  Larger amounts will look cooler for photos, but give a lower framerate.
			 
Roads are more numerous than buildings, and in a lot of cases you can't even see roads that are too distant past all of the buildings.  The default of 4 should work well even in parts of the city that are not densely populated.

Setting/setting/=UseUnrestricteUIUpdateSpeedsdescription|Normally, most UI windows only update their contents every 50-100 milliseconds.  If your framerate is much higher than this, however, you may prefer that the UI update at whatever your actual framerate is.
           
This will likely reduce your framerate, potentially substantially, but it leads to the ultimate in responsiveness.

Setting/setting/=MousewheelUIScrollSpeeddescription|How fast should the scroll wheel move UI scrollbars when you spin it?  The default value is 30, which should be comfortable for most folks.  But if your OS has unusual settings, and the in-game interface feels like it scrolls to slowly, then go for a higher number.  If it's too fast, go for a lower number.
Setting/setting/=InvertMouseWheelUIScrollingdisplay_name|Invert Mousewheel UI Scrolling
Setting/setting/=InvertMouseWheelUIScrollingdescription|Normally when you spin the mouse wheel forward, any scrollable areas you are hovering over in the UI go up; spinning backwards goes down.
