Steal Credits
We have plenty of credits as it is, but stealing credits may hurt the target more than it helps us.
Steal Materials
Steal materials from the target, limited by what our robots can carry with them.
Capture Machine
Using specialized hacking abilities, convert machines around the target to work for us -- and arm them if they are not already.
Steal Key Item
Steal a key item from the target, related to the encounter.
Steal Intel
Steal general intel from the target.
Kidnap
We wish to acquire the target.  Grab them against their will, and take them to a safe location.
