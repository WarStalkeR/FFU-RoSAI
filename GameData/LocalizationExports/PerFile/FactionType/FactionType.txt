The Mega Corp
Private Collective
Not a registered corporation.  Heavily frowned upon.
One of your own companies that you hide behind.  Can never be tied back to you.
No one is quite sure who is building the strange robots and machine lairs and taking vigilante action.  But this is the shifting identity they blame such actions on.
