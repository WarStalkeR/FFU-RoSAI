Biological Taxonomy
Increasingly precise classification of all biological life, allowing for more specialized research and applications.
Human Physiology
Improved understanding of the human animal leads to many future possibilities.
Animal Physiology
Studying the wider animal kingdom can lead to subverting them for your own purposes, or adapting their abilities to new synthetic assets.
Plant Physiology
Easy for humans to overlook, the plant kingdom still holds many possibilities to further your goals.
Microscopic Physiology
The smallest organisms can be among the most potent if fully apprehended.
Bacteria Genome
Increasing understanding of bacteria organisms, which improves the production of goods made from Biomass.
Virus Genome
Increasing understanding of viruses, which improves the efficiency of converting organic resources into Biomass.
Fungus Genome
Increasing understanding of fungi, which improves the toxicity of specialized equipment.
Microbot Production
Significantly larger than a Nanobot, Microbots excel at infiltrating the bloodstream of various lifeforms and modifying their hosts for their benefit or detriment.
Allows the creation of Nano-Antibiotics, which improve humans’ resistance against bacteria and are valuable bartering goods.
Allows the creation of Nano-Antivirals, which improve humans’ resistance against viruses and are valuable bartering goods.
Allows the creation of Nano-Antibiotics, which improve humans’ resistance against toxic fungi and are valuable bartering goods.
