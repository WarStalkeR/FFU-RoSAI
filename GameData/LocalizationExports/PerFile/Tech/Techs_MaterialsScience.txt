Pliable Metals
There are many benefits to metals that can flex without fracturing.
Fireproof Lairs
Increases Machine Lair resistance against fires.
Diffusive Polymers
Effective against laser-based weaponry.
Ablative Fibers
Materials which burn or boil off, preventing heat from damaging the internal structure.
Allows the creation of the Hauler. Slow but strong, the Hauler is great for hauling things -- or making a surprise smash. Without armor it can't take much punishment, as it's not designed for serious combat.
Electrothermal Accelerator
Accelerate projectiles by means of a plasma discharge between electrodes, generating a rapid increase in pressure. Allows the production of plasma-based weapons and equipment.
CompositeArmor
Nanotechnology makes it possible to produce in high volume armors made of ultra-thin layers of different materials. The result is superior protection than any one material individually.
Miniature Anti Grav Pads
Very advanced tech to allow small objects to hover; doesn't seem possible to scale up at this time.
A larger and boxier variant of the Hauler, Tankers can carry unheard-of loads, making them attractive to human customers. Unfortunately for the humans, these can also be transformed into killing machines.
