Flocking Behavior
Improves nanoswarms coordination and maneuverability, with returns on repeated investment.
Metamaterial
A coating applied to an object that allows electromagnetic radiation to pass freely around it. This tech enables the production of basic cloaking equipment that goes undetected by non-augmented sensors.
Nanolenses
Nanoparticles can conceal large objects by diverting the light around them from all directions. Improves cloaking equipment with each investment.
Metalenses
Metalens offers a substantial improvement over traditional lenses, allowing light to be focused down to a single point on even the smallest of scales. Improves laser-based weapons and equipment with each investment.
Nano Cohesion
Nanobots form increasingly stable swarms.
Active Cloaking
Cloaking devices are modularized to equip even larger mechs. Cloaking equipment becomes more resistant to sensors with each investment.
Holographic Fidelity
Able to produce increasingly realistic holograms that are capable of maintaining stability in harsh conditions. Investing in this tech improves mechsâ€™ Psyops capabilities.
Liquid Metal Production
Unlocks the Liquid Metal unit, an advanced variant of the Predator.  Cannot be upgraded with as much intelligence, but the liquid metal allows for shapeshifting as well as even better self-repair.
Protector Production
