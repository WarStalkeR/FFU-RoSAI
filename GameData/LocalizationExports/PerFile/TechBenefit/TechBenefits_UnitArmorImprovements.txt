Reinforced Frame
A better manufacturing process allows us to create versatile robotic chassis which are considerably stronger than usual.
CPU Shielding
Insulated shielding is nanowoven into the structures that house a unit's main processing core, making it more resilient versus electromagnetic damage.
Denser Armor
Reinforced armor provides better protection with no change in bulk. The weight would cripple a human being, but our robots can barely notice it.
BicameralMind
The creation of a separate, secured processing core allows our units to keep fighting even when hit with a debilitating EMP attack.
Regenerative Armor
Nanobots infused into armor plates provide limited repair capabilities on the field.
Polished Reflective Armor Plates
Lightweight armored mirror plates, capable of reflecting beam weapons and deflecting small caliber projectiles.
Capacitive Armor
Kinectic charging modular armor plates convert incoming damage into energy blasts.
Redundant Systems
A clever redesign of our units critical systems means they can keep operating after withstanding severe damage.
