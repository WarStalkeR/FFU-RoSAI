Virus Mutation
Allows you to intentionally mutate existing viruses.  If the new strain is fitter than the old, it will become dominant.
Virus Invention
Allows you to intentionally invent and introduce new viruses into the city.
Fungal Mutation
Allows you to intentionally mutate existing fungal infections in the city.  If the new strain is fitter than the old, it will become dominant.
Bacteria Mutation
Allows you to intentionally mutate existing bacteria in the city.  If the new strain is fitter than the old, it will become dominant.
Parasite Mutation
Allows you to intentionally mutate existing microscopic parasites in the city.  Typically protozoa, helminths, or ectoparasites.  If the new strain is fitter than the old, it will become dominant.
Prion Invention
Allows you to intentionally invent and introduce new prion diseases into the city.  Prion diseases are always fatal, and are hard to spread.
Virus Vaccine Development
Allows you to invent vaccines for viruses, including viruses you introduced yourself.
Antiviral Development
Allows you to invent antivirals for treating viral infections.
Antifungal Development
Allows you to invent antifungal medicines for treating fungal infections.
Antibacterial Development
Allows you to invent antibacterial medicines for treating or preventing bacterial infections.
Antiprotozoa Development
Allows you to invent antiprotozoa medicines for treating or preventing parasitic protozoa infections.
Antihelminth Development
Allows you to invent antihelminth medicines for treating or preventing parasitic helminth (worms) infections.
Antiectoparasitic Development
Allows you to invent antiectoparasitic medicines for treating or preventing ectoparasitic infections (fleas, ticks, and other things that live on the surface).
