Standard Drop Pod
Single-use armored rocket capsule, used to deliver a combat unit into combat quickly and with prejudice.
Breaching Drop Pod
Reinforced frame equipped with hard hitting laser drill tip allows this drop pod to reach basements and highly protected areas.
Explosive Drop Pod
Explosive charges on the outside of the drop pod explode upon arrival, creating an airburst effect which eliminates hostiles with maximum prejudice.
EMP Drop Pod
EMP-coils on the drop pod trigger on impact, shortening all non-reinforced electronics in the area.
Stormpod Stun Drop Pod
Shock and Awe, stuns hostiles on impact (besides the ones that are killed/stunned by being under the drop pod, of course).
Atomic Drop Pod
A tiny amount of radioctive material is stored within the drop pod's outer shell and released on impact. Extremely deadly to organics.
