Standard Transport
Basic automated transport, capable of carrying several troops into battle relatively undetected. Unable to avoid active scans or dodge heavy anti-aircraft fire.
Stealth Transport
Equipped with ECM jamming tech and stealth coating, this transport can carry a medium number of units into combat fully undetected. Bypasses early warning systems and alarms, but can still be targeted by anti-aricraft flak batteries when flying near highly defended areas.
Support Transport
A heavily armored version of the standard transport, capable of carrying fewer troops but equipped with a full array of support equipment such as nanobot dispensers, jamming tech, fire support circuits, and scanners.
