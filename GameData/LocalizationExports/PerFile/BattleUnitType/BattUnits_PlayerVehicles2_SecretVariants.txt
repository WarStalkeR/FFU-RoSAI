Strider
Taller and faster cousin to the Shambler. Not quite as much of a brick on legs, but better suited for close combat with human mechs.
Blight
This small mech is barely larger the Shambler technolgy it is based on, but it trades a lot of the armor-piercing capabilities for extreme speed and the ability to dominate close-quarters combat.
Tanker
A larger and boxier version of the hauler, this one is meant for the open road. Using treads or legs as the situation requires, they can carry unheard-of loads, making them attractive to human customers. Unfortunately for the humans, these can also be transformed into killing machines.
