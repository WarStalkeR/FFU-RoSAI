Hauler
Ungainly able to fold up to look like any other cargo. The fact that it looks so unrelated to the Predators and other scarier robots in your arsenal means people often look right past it.  Slow but strong, the hauler is great for hauling things -- or making a surprise smash. Without armor it can't take much punishment, as it's definitely not a combat bot.
Shambler
Our own interpretation of those 'mechs' the humans like to make. Standing about three meters tall, it's too large to go into most buildings, but too small to smash through most of them. Specializes in withstanding large amounts of enemy fire while firing heavy rounds that take out enemy vehicles or disable larger enemy mechs.
Rocket Sled
A downsized hovertank design fitted with rockets to allow it to boost into battle unaided.  Once at the battlefield it can only hover, but its rocket boost makes for much more flexible deployment options.
