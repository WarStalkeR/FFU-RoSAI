Nanoswarm
A swarm of nanobots. Deadly, regenerative, and almost invisible, but not as resilient as proper robots. Great for infiltration, stealth, or certain kinds of sabotage.
Predator
Heavily-plated robotic warrior. Relentless and incredibly strong, but not exactly stealthy. A single non-upgraded, unarmed Predator is the equal of ten human commandos.
Keanu
Fast, flexible, and brutal robotic warrior. Unable to tank hits like a Predator, instead putting a premium on moving so skillfully it doesn't get hit at all.
Leech
Able to hover via miniature anti-gravity pads. About the size of a small bird, this bot is deeply unsettling to humans as well as highly skilled at taking control of enemy bots and vehicles.
Cyborg
Robotic interior with a living tissue exterior. May be good at infiltration, depending on how realistic the tissues, programming, and other features are; or may just unsettle humans by existing in the uncanny valley.
