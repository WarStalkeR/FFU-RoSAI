Gold Circuits
Better than copper wires, but exponentially more expensive. Used in high-tech electronics.
Platinum Plating
Precious white metal, used in high-tech electronics.
Computer
Processors, RAM, motherboard, and everything that you need to have a bona-fide computer. Can be used standalone, or modified to go into vehicles and robots.
Battery
Used in everything from mobile phones to planes, batteries are an essential part of modern life (as is charging them).
PowerCell
Bigger and more powerful than batteries, power cells allow mechs, robots, and vehicles to operate for a long time with recharging.
Portable Power Generator
Portable device, capable of providing considerable amounts of energy for a considerable amount of time.
NavComputer
Specialized device capable of pinpointing coordinates, charting paths, and even perform astronavigation. Planes and drones need them, cars like them, mechs can use them.
Radar Module
Radar device, capable of pinging areas and identifying targets.
Comms Module
Used to communicate with other devices, be they cell towers, satellites, or radios.
AutoPilot Module
Autonomous control has gone leaps and bounds since the early days of assisted navigation, and vehicles and drones are capable of fully navigating enviroments when equipped with this module.
Sensor Suite Module
Scanners, LIDARs, thermals, and many other detector sensors are packed in this scouting module.
Electronic Counter-Measures Module
While most of stealth is down to materials and shapes, there are several electronic tricks to avoid sensors. This module packs all of them.
GravThrusters
Wheels still have value, but few things beat the practicality of a hover/flight thruster.
