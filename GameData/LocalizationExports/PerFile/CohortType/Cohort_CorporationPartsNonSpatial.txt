Administration
The entire administrative apparatus for a corporation. Ranging from the C-Suite to the board of directors, to sectorial administrators.
C-Suite
The top executives running the corporation, mainly the CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, and so on. Their locations are ever-shifting, and often outside of the city itself.  To find them, you'd have to do something to draw them out.
Board Of Directors
The board of directors of the corporations acts as a form of check and balance on the C-Suite, supposedly.  They can remove top executives if they are unhappy with their performance. The specific members of the board, and their locations, are almost impossible to pin down.
Sector Administrators
The corporations are heavily diversified, and there is a specific individual in charge of each sector of work they are engaged in. The sector administrators all work as a loose team, overseeing their individual massive departments. They report to the C-Suite. Internally they are competitors with one another, as well as a close-knit group of colleagues.
