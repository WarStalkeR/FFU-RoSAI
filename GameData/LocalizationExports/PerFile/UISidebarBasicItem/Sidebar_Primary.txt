What do you have stored for use?
District Info
Spreading your machine lairs between multiple districts is much more cost-effective and also gives you greater visibility into what factions are doing.
Build New Lairs
Pick buildings of the humans for infestation with your own hidden machine lairs.
Tech Tree
Upgrading techs gives you new or improved capabilities, unit types, machine lairs, and more.  Research in many domains is one of your highest priorities as a machine intelligence.
Enter Battle Mode
Take a battle mode view of the current location, and consider fighting units from encounters in this area.

Design the standing army you wish to have availble.
Neuro Net Policies
Change settings to the NeuroNet.
Exit Battle Mode
Exit battle mode, returning you to the normal view of the city.  If you've just been scouting, this has no effect on anything.
		
If you've deployed units or attacked units, this battlefield will persist for a short time as the humans deal with the aftermath.
