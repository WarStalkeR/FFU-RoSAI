Transports allow us to fly our units to where we want, landing squads quietly on rooftops or bringing ground vehicles into battle.
Drop Pods
Drop Pods are a very fast way of getting squad-sized units into action, and as a bonus they can cause collateral damger.  However, stealth is right out; they draw a lot of attention. Different types of Drop Pods have different properties and effects on impact.
