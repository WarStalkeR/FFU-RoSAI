ProfessionType/profession_type/=Administrativedisplay_name|Administrative
ProfessionType/profession_type/=Administrativedescription|Ranging from noble Chief Executive work, all the way through the upper executive ranks down into lowly middle-managerdom.  It's still better to be an administrator than any other form of work, if you're looking for a comfortable life.  Angry the wrong political opponents and you can wind up in prison, however, so it's good to make sure even your private opinions are safe ones.
ProfessionType/profession_type/=HighSciencesdisplay_name|High Sciences
ProfessionType/profession_type/=HighSciencesdescription|The back that pulls the plow of society, or something.  Society is actually quite stagnant, so they must not be pulling hard enough.  Anyone with a doctoral degree or advanced credentialing is considered high sciences for tax purposes.  Doctors, professors, scientists, highest-quality engineers, lawyers, and so on.
ProfessionType/profession_type/=OfficeWorkdisplay_name|Office Work
ProfessionType/profession_type/=OfficeWorkdescription|The lucrative but thankless side of middle-class work offerings.  Office work might be important, vital even -- or it might be just filling out paperwork to document the existence of other paperwork.  You never can tell until you have the job, and once you're in a job, you don't dare complain.
ProfessionType/profession_type/=Creativedisplay_name|Creative
ProfessionType/profession_type/=Creativedescription|Pay is the worst out of all the middle-class work offerings, but job satisfaction is... also not great?  Writers, artists, musicians, and other dreamers... well, they're probably working on advertising or brochures, let's be honest.  A lucky few get to work in film or other entertainment media, and the censorship is actually lower than you might expect.
ProfessionType/profession_type/=SkilledLabordisplay_name|Skilled Labor
ProfessionType/profession_type/=SkilledLabordescription|The pay might be midrange, but the respect is off the charts.  These are the fixers, the people who know how objects fit together and machines are supposed to operate.  If you have at least a two-year degree and know something about something, you might find yourself one of the most satisfied individuals in the city -- if you can find and afford an apprenticeship, that is.
ProfessionType/profession_type/=MenialLabordisplay_name|Menial Labor
ProfessionType/profession_type/=MenialLabordescription|Day labor, construction, janitorial.  It's not much pay and it's even less respect, but unless there are a lot of improvements to robotics, you at least have job security.
